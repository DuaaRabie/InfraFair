The model has being used in these research projects:

- `Quantitative assessment of Regional Cost Allocation Methods in the West African Power Pool <https://www.iit.comillas.edu/publicacion/proyecto/en/AFRICA_COST_ALLOC/Quantitative_assessment_of_Regional_Cost_Allocation_Methods_in_the_West_African_Power_Pool>`_ 
  developed for `CESI S.p.A <https://www.cesi.it/>`_. July 2023 - July 2024. `L. Olmos <https://www.iit.comillas.edu/people/olmos>`_, 
  `M.A.E. Elabbas <https://www.iit.comillas.edu/people/mabbas>`_, `S. Gómez Sánchez <https://www.iit.comillas.edu/people/sgomez>`_
   
   It aims to apply and evaluate several methodologies for the computation of electricity transmission tariffs to allocate the 
   cost of the regional transmission grid in the `West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) <https://www.ecowapp.org/>`_ to derive regulatory and policy recommendations.

- `Open Modelling Toolbox for development of long-term pathways for the energy system in Africa (OpenMod4Africa) <https://www.iit.comillas.edu/proyectos/mostrar_proyecto.php.en?nombre_abreviado=OpenMod4Africa>`_, 
  developed for the `European Union <https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en>`_. July 2023 - June 2026.
  `L. Olmos <https://www.iit.comillas.edu/people/olmos>`_, `S. Lumbreras <https://www.iit.comillas.edu/people/slumbreras>`_, 
  `A. Ramos <https://www.iit.comillas.edu/people/aramos>`_, `M.A.E. Elabbas <https://www.iit.comillas.edu/people/mabbas>`_

    It aims to develop an open toolbox populated with state-of-the-art models for analysing long-term pathways to sustainable, secure and competitive energy systems in Africa.
    The Toolbox will build on EU projects like openENTRANCE, Plan4RES and FocusAfrica, and will adapt and further develop open models in accordance with the African context and needs.
    The models are scalable, and can be applied to cities, industries and countries. Furthermore, a main objective for OpenMod4Africa is capacity building among energy models in academia.
    Four African universities will be actively involved in adapting models and conducting two regional case studies. The additional capacity and the open Toolbox will enable the universities
    to train new generations of energy modelling experts for the energy industries in Africa.
