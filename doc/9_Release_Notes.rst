 Release Notes
##########################################

The first release of InfraFair contains the core of the model with the basic feature of 
exporting raw results in the form of .csv files. In this release, special attention was 
given to the electricity infrastructure, as this is the field in which the model was 
scientifically conceived. Below are some of the features we are considering in future releases.

* Register the model in the Python Package Index (PyPI). 
* Add graphical representations for the results.
* Program soft linkages with other software, e.g., the PSS/E software for electricity infrastructure, and integrated assessment platforms, e.g., the IAMC Scenario Explorer. 
* Include consideration and applications for other flow-based infrastructure, potentially gas, hydrogen and heat infrastructure.
* Feature an interactive option for users to create their own network from scratch.
